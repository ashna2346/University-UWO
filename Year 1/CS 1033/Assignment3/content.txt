Sports are a vital aspect of any progressive society.
The world of sports is not immune to gender bias, as evidenced by the notably lopsided coverage of women’s sports by the media and the disproportionate level of brand sponsorship spend allocated to men’s sports. This situation changes, however, when the eyes of the world focus on the Olympics, the only global sporting event characterized by true gender parity.
If sport can play a role in society today, it is precisely in strengthening the areas of cooperation for peace between nations. In this way sport can give all of us, and especially young people everywhere, hope for a better, a more peaceful future.
The Olympics features men and women competing in the same events in the same stadiums for gold, silver and bronze medals of equal importance.
In 1971, Alan Shephard and Edgar Mitchell made history when they became the first people to play sport on the moon. The Apollo 14 astronauts participated in what Mitchell later jokingly described as “the first lunar Olympics”. Shephard hit a golf ball while Mitchell threw a makeshift javelin – it was actually a staff they’d used in one of their scientific experiments.
The five Olympic rings represent the five major regions of the world - Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Oceana.
