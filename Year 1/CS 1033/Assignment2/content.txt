One of the most beautiful universities in Canada - Western University!

Established in 1878, Western is ranked number five on this list of most beautiful universities in Canada. In 2004, Western even beat out Banff National Park in the Canada Blooms competition in the Parks and Grounds category! 

Originally the university was scattered around London. Then in 1918, the current campus property was purchased by Western from the Kingsmill family. University College was one of the first buildings constructed on campus in 1923. Another iconic building on the campus is Middlesex College. Stop by MC and get a drink at the Grad Club. 

This website will give you a little introduction to the campus and our favourite building. If you have any questions about our amazing university, reach out to us at westernrocks@uwo.ca

MIDDLESEX COLLEGE PAGE CONTENT
********************************************************

Middlesex College is one of the most well known buildings on campus because of the clock tower. It was build in 1959. The majestic bells of the clock used to ring throughout the campus on the hour, half hour and quarter hour. Unfortunately the bells were decommissioned in 2007. 
 
As of 2022, the following departments are located in Middlesex College: Math, Applied Math and Computer Science.  Middlesex also houses the Grad Club, a pub specifically for Masters and PhD students. The Grad Club is located in the basement of Middlesex College. Upon completion of your degree, you can take a drink from the legendary "Goblet of Knowledge" in the Grad Club.

The steps at the front main door of Middlesex College has served as the backdrop for many photographs of Western students on the day of their convocation.

RESIDENCES PAGE CONTENT

Residence life is more than just a place to rest your head, it is a life changing experience in which you will make life long friends!

Fun Fact: originally all residences were named after local rivers. If you are driving around Southwestern Ontario, you might see rivers with the same name as Western residences. 

There are three main styles of residences at Western. Below are residences styles and the building within each category:

- Traditional Style - one or two students in a small room and a shared washroom for the floor. 
- Suite Style - one student per bedroom with a shared kitchen between 4 students.
- Hybrid Style - two students per bedroom but still a bit more private than the traditional style as the bathroom is just shared between 2 students.

~Traditional Style~

Delaware - Opened in 1965, Delaware literally marks an X on the campus! 
Medway/Sydenham - Medway Hall was constructed in 1958 and then Sydenham was added in 1961. Although co-ed now, both were originally all male residences.
